## IS-What?

ISR stands for *incremental static regeneration*. It's a technique that I first
heard a while ago when reading about the framework [Next.js][0] and that I'll
talk more about in this post. But first some context.

## SSG, SSR, CSR

More acronyms? Unfortunatelly, yes. I'm not a fan of acronyms but these ones
appear to be wildely used these days on the frontend tech circles. But don't
worry, we'll go through each one of them.

### CSR: Client Side Rendering

Starting with the last, CSR, or client side rendering, means that the browser
(the client) is responsible for rendering the content of a website. It is
normally what you would expect from a React app by default when using
create-react-app: when you access a webpage, the server sends javascript to the
browser, then the browser parses that javascript, execute it and the get the
html to display to you. One of the biggest drawbacks of this approach is that
you have to wait a longer time to get to see some content on the page, when
compared to the other approaches.

### SSR: Server Side Rendering

This approach is older than client side rendering. It's what was done when using
php, for instance. When you hit a webpage, the server is responsible for
generating the html specific to your request and send it to the browser, so when
it receives the response the html is ready to be displayed. Next.js is a
framework that brings this approach to React.
Interestingly enough, CSR was born to make for a faster experience for the user.
I said earlier that CSR takes a longer time to show the first meaningful content
to the user. But if it is expected that the user makes lots of page transitions,
SSR can feel slower than CSR, because for each navigation between pages, a new
request has to be made to the server to fetch the html for said page, so SSR
also has its drawbacks.

### SSG: Static Site Generation

When you have a website where the content of its pages don't need to change
between requests, like this blog post(!), you could generate its html (and js
and styles, which I forgot to mention on the other approaches) once and store them somewhere else, like a CDN, which could be closer to where the user visiting
the website is, without the need to request the server. The massive advantage of
this approach is that it is blazing fast ðŸ”¥. The biggest drawback is that, as
the names says, it is not dynamic. If I had to make a change on this blog post,
I would need to build it again (generate its html, js, css) and update the CDNs
with the new version. Luckily, Next.js also supports this technique and does all
that work for us.

With all these approaches introduced, we can finally talk about the magic!

## The magic

As I mentioned before, this blog is a perfect fit for static site generation
(just like many blogs ðŸ˜¬). I don't plan to change the contents of the pages very
often and I want everybody who access the posts to see the same content. But
yesterday I wanted to do something different. I wanted my photos page to show
my photos uploaded to flickr. And I didn't want to rebuild the blog every time
I uploaded a new photo to flickr. So I saw the perfect opportunity to use the
magic of incremental static regeneration. Without going into too much
[details][1] (because I don't know much about it), you simply add a `revalidate`
attribute on the return of a page's `getStaticProps` to turn on ISR.

On my photos page, inside `getStaticProps`, I made a call to flickr api to get
my photos and embed them on the page. Adding the `revalidate: 3600` to the
return of the method makes Next.js trigger a regeneration of the previously
built page on the background when 3600 seconds have passed since the first
request to the page, which will fetch any new photo I took without me having to
rebuild my blog!


## Conclusion

With ISR, activated with a [single line of code][2], I can have a piece of
dynamic content inside my static website, having the benefits of both worlds.
Arthur C. Clarke once said that [any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic][3]. I like to think that we can learn a new piece
of technology and even fully understand it so it doesn't feel that much
advanced anymore (which I hope to do with ISR, some day), but still keep that
feeling of seeing something magical ðŸª„.
